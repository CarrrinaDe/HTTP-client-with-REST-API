A HTTP client communicating with a REST API. Other concepts involved: sockets, DNS, IP, JSON, JWT, cookies.
I coded in C and used functions from its libraries.
For parsing JSON, I used Parson library: https://github.com/kgabis/parson
There were 5 tasks; each one was revealed in the response body from the previous task.
The first one was to make a GET request on /task1/start.
The responses contained cookies and a JWT token at some point.
